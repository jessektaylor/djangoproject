        The line chart is designed to see if there are correlations between price and sentiment. This chart has three separate axis. The left axis reflects the sentiment rating. The right axis reflects the price of the given asset. The price data is currently collected after market close each day. I plan to start collecting this on an hourly interval.  The percent change reflects the percent difference from the first and last price data for the given window.

             Each post/comment is analyzed using three independent sentiment analysis packages 
             ( <a href='https://pypi.org/project/vaderSentiment/'>VaderSentiment</a>, 
             <a href='https://pypi.org/project/textblob/'>TextBlob</a>, 
             <a href='https://pypi.org/project/flair/'>Flair</a>) to determine the aggregate sentiment. Both Vader and TextBlob use a rule based approach that rates sentiment using a lexicon and other information such as frequency and relational data. FLair uses a different approach  using a pre-trained LSTM neural network. This approach takes into account the sequence of letters and words when predicting to better understand the true nature of the sentiment.

                Asset values  are collected by scraping yahoo for price data. The data collected has only one value for each day. The sentiment and price data frames are joined on the common datetime axis. Since the sentiment is on an hourly basis and the price is on a daily basis missing points are created using linear interpolation. This has many limitations and does not actually reflect the real price action. In the future price data will be collected on an hourly basis to provide more accurate price action.
