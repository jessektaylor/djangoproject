    The size of each node represents the amount of times that a ticker was mentioned within the given parameters (days, ticker displayed) relative to all the other tickers in the treechart. The color is a measure of that ticker's sentiment relative to the others. Currently there are greater than 8000 tickers that are being searched.

           Each post/comment is analyzed using three independent sentiment analysis packages 
           ( <a href='https://pypi.org/project/vaderSentiment/'>VaderSentiment</a>, 
           <a href='https://pypi.org/project/textblob/'>TextBlob</a>, 
           <a href='https://pypi.org/project/flair/'>Flair</a>) to determine the aggregate sentiment. Both Vader and TextBlob use a rule based approach that rates sentiment using a lexicon and other information such as frequency and relational data. FLair uses a different approach  using a pre-trained LSTM neural network. This approach takes into account the sequence of letters and words when predicting to better understand the true nature of the sentiment.

            The color represents the sentiment for each post/comment relative to each other.  A dark green color represents that the ticker sentiment is greater relative to the other tickers shown. The darker the red the more negative the sentiment relative to the other tickers. Itâ€™s important to note that a green or red color does not necessarily indicate a negative or positive sentiment but rather its position relative to the other tickers show.

           Reddit posts/comments are searched for tickers stored in a databse. These posts/comments are examined via regular expression, and also by experimenting with extracting the nouns to eliminate false positives. Currently there are more than 8000 tickers that are being searched for many of which are common words which intern returns many false positives. Users are encouraged to black list tickers which they believe are not relevant. Black listed tickers are forever removed from all charts on the site unless you choose to add them back at any time.
